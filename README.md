# Behavioural synchrony scores
R codes for calculation within-species and between species behavioural synchrony metrics.

All codes are ran on R (version 3.6.3) in the RStudio environment.

Before running the codes, make sure your data format (.csv) is something like:

The data must include:
- The behaviours of both species.
- The frequency of the occurrence of the behaviour at a scan/time point.
- Also, the number of the behaviours observed for both species must be identical.
